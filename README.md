## Introduction

Constraint programming is a paradigm used to solve combinatorial problems by defining constraints that must be satisfied. This project focuses on implementing algorithms and techniques in C to efficiently solve problems in this domain.

## Features

- Implementations of core constraint programming algorithms.
- Examples of solving combinatorial problems like scheduling.
- Modular and extensible codebase for experimenting with new techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the code in this repository, you need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make (optional, for build automation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Dimbsb/Constraints_programming.git
   cd Constraints_programming
2. Compile the code:
  gcc -o output mc1.c  ....(mc2.c....mc3.c)

### Usage
1. Run the main program:
   ./output

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.
